1. Navigation is as follows. A right-click menu provides toggling capabilities. Escape quits, User arrow keys to manipulate cannon and space bar to fire.

2. Special functions implemented is an Entity Framework (although it was not fully utilized in order to follow instructions fully).

4. One thing that I consider important is the bullets in the game are not continuously created but instead I use a Bullet Pool.
